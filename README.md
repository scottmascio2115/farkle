An arcade style dice game play alone or with a friend

Skizzle is an arcade style dice game loosely based on the game Farkle. A player can play alone or with a friend. A player starts with 6 dice and after every throw has two options. Either risk it and throw the remaining dice not used in the combination, or preserve the score and alternate turns.When you risk it a player throws the remaining dice in hopes of getting Skizzling dice!

The reward for Skizzling dice is the accumulation of the whole turns score, a 1000 point bonus and its still your turn! The advantage of risking it is a player has a higher reward but they also have a higher risk of being Skizzled! Being Skizzled is when a player throws the dice and none of the dice qualify for any of the combinations. When a player gets Skizzled there total score is reset to zero!

You will have to weigh risk vs reward after every throw! Please visit www.skizzledice.com and try to get the high score.
